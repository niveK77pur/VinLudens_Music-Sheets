Welcome! I am [VinLudens](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdBt0itOxHS80p_yS5fUELw) and this is my GitHub repository containing all the sheets with their respective code I have written in [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) thus far. Consider this a sort of archive.

Lilypond is basically the equivalent to [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) but for writing music scores. I have my workflow in combination with [Vim](https://github.com/niveK77pur/.vim "my vim configs") and [Frescobaldi](http://www.frescobaldi.org/index.html) which allows me to produce my sheets fairly quickly and without too much trouble.

# About this repository

The sheets are usually accompanied by a MIDI file generated by Lilypond. This way you can have a listen to a rough version of the piece in case there is no recording (yet). If you want to hear an actual and proper recording, check out the links below.

Note that in the directories starting with either `ARR-xxx`, `QA-xxx` or `OC-xxx` the sheets are done or very close to being finished. The rest is either work-in-progress; other random projects that are neither arrangements or original compositions; or even abandoned projects. 

One last note on the `QA-xxx` (aka Quick Arrangements) sheets. You will see that there are missing numbers; but don't worry they are not lost! I just haven't created sheets for the QA corresponding to the missing numbers *as, for the most part, I am not planning to make sheets for my Quick Arrangements*.
